# RYDAR
University campuses are micro-urban ecosystems, yet their transit systems remain outdated and inefficient. RYDAR bridges this gap by using IoT, AI, and blockchain to transform fixed, schedule-based transport into a smart, data-driven system that shifts mobility from “wait-and-see” to a seamless predict-and-move experience while reducing emissions.
